# It's beginning to look a lot like christmas

This is the place where I upload all my (probably) very bad tries and solutions for Advent of Code.

### Folder structure

```
└── [year]
     └── [day]
          ├── commit: [year] day [day] part 1 [lang]
          └── commit: [year] day [day] part 2 [lang]
```

Congrats if you understood it immediately, you are very smart!

But yes, the solutions are in their own folders with parts one and two being two separate commits with the format `[year] day [day] part [part] [lang]`. So an example could be the folder `2024/1` with the commit: `2024 day 1 part 1 OCaml`.
